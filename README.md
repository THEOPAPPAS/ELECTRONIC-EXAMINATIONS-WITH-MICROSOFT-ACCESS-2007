ELECTRONIC EXAMINATIONS WITH MICROSOFT ACCESS 2007 - ADMIN AND CLIENT PARTS
The existing testing system in many educational institutions is not automated. Thus, through this app, we are introducing a new system, which is fully computerized. The main objective of this online test system is that it helps to conduct the examinations on any number of candidates at once in an automated manner. It saves the entire process of each exam safely and makes the search for records easier and more efficient. It is also able to effectively evaluate the candidate in depth and thus saves enough time.
The system administrator prepares the questions for each exam. Candidates can log in through the computers on a local network with their registry number that they have been given and can take part in the exam. Questions are given in random order so that the probability for questions with the same order for the examiner is nil.
A timer monitors the time of the examination process, and after the time limit set by various system parameters, the test automatically stops. The analysis of the results is immediate and is done by the system with considerable time savings, and in addition does not require the physical presence of the teachers, who with the old system should have been present in the examination.
